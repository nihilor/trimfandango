# trimfandango

Advanced trimming of strings by providing lists of characters or full strings.

## Installation

Just run the following command:

```
npm install trimfandango
```

## Syntax

The basic syntax:

```js
Function trimFandango(String text, (Array|String charlist)): String
```

The `trimFandango()` function removes a set of characters from both ends of a string. By default it removes all whitespaces characters: `nul`-bytes, ordinary whitespaces, horizontal and vertical tabs, new lines and carriage returns. It returns the trimmed string.

* `0x00`, ASCII 00, `NUL`-byte
* `0x09`, ASCII 09, tab
* `0x0A`, ASCII 10, new line/line feed
* `0x0B`, ASCII 11, vertical tab
* `0x0D`, ASCII 13, carriage return
* `0x20`, ASCII 32, whitespace

## Description

Change the trimming behaviour by optionally providing a `charlist`. The `charlist` can be an `Array` or any other value. Be aware, that any other value than an array will be converted to a string.

### Array of characters

If you provide an array of single characters, all matched characters in any order will be removed from the beginning and the end of the string. You can either provide normal characters, unicode or specific regular expression tokens. In case of tokens take care that you double-backslash them, i.e. `\\s` instead of `\s`.

```js
console.log(
    trimFandango(
        '#55  ### #55 55ยง5   FOOBAR   # 55ยง&    ',
        ["\\s","#","&","5","ยง"]
    )
)
```

The output:

```js
FOOBAR
```

### String of characters

If you provide a string of characters - or any other value that converts to a string - the string and its possible subsets will removed from both ends of the `text`.

```js
console.log(
    trimFandango(
        '12FOOBAR23',
        123
    )
)
```
The output:

```js
FOOBAR
```

## Trivia

1. trimfandango is heavily inspired by the `trim()` function of PHP.
2. The name is a reminiscence to Grim Fandango, authored by the awesome [Tim Schafer](https://twitter.com/TimOfLegend).
